# Sorting-Visualizer
âœ… Step-by-Step Guide:
Open Terminal
You're already there at:
kaushalkumar@kaushals-MacBook-Air ~ %
Navigate to the directory where pp.cpp is located
If it's in Documents, type:
cd ~/Documents
If it's on Desktop:

cd ~/Desktop
Compile the code using g++
Run:
g++ pp.cpp -o sortviz
This compiles pp.cpp into an executable named sortviz.
If there are no errors, the prompt will return silently.
Run the executable
Run:
./sortviz
